__Milestone 3__
* __Screenshots of Skeleton:__
* __Changes to Paper Prototype (#1):__ 
1. No need for both feed and photo gallery in the homepage, so feed was taken out. 
2. Added a filtering bar to filter the images in the gallery to the ones specific to a location. 
3. Removed the Posts page from the prototype; there is no need for a page specific to all posts besides the homepage. There will however be
   single post page that displays the details of a single post when it is clicked.
